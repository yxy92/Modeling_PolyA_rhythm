By checking the result in version V3, we settle down the method to calculate the Sobol indices.


Simulation scheme


Models: A1B1D1, A1B1C1D1, B1C1D1 (check manuscript to see if it needs Sobol indices calculation)





			--- Nested Sampling    Group Number = 25,000; Group Size = 4;  10 independent trials
Sampling Method:	sobol indices calculation: use resultant vector for circular outputs	
			

			--- Wiki's Sampling    Sample Size = 100,000;  10 independent trials
			sobol indices calculation: treating circular outputs as non-circular
